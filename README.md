# Welcome to My M And A

## Task
The challenge here was to merge three datasets from csv files 
into a single SQL database. 

## Description
The challenge was solved by reading the csv files using pandas, 
carrying out data processing steps for each dataset, merging 
into a single csv, and utilizing the csv_to_sql function from 
my_ds_babel.py to convert the merged csv into an SQL database. 

## Installation
The project requires a Python 3 installation, the my_ds_babel.py 
program, and pandas and sqlite3 to be installed. 

## Usage
The data needs to be accessed prior to program execution. The three 
datasets can be downloaded with the wget <link> command in the terminal 
for three links: 

https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/only_wood_customer_us_1.csv 

https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/only_wood_customer_us_2.csv

https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/only_wood_customer_us_3.csv

Once the data is downloaded, execute the my_m_and_a.py program via the 
terminal, and the datasets will be merged and converted to an SQL db.
